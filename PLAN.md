## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Invitation management
CREATE TABLE invitations (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, -- invitation code
  family_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  max_guests INTEGER NOT NULL,
  email TEXT,
  phone TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  last_access TIMESTAMP
);

-- Guest tracking
CREATE TABLE guests (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  invitation_id TEXT REFERENCES invitations(id),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  attending BOOLEAN DEFAULT NULL,
  meal_preference TEXT,
  dietary_restrictions TEXT,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Invitation Distribution

- Generate unique codes for each invitation
- Create both QR codes and direct links: `https://wedding.bogdanfloris.com/{invite-code}`
- Send via WhatsApp with both QR image and clickable link
- Track access and completion

### Security Measures

- CSRF protection on all forms
- Input sanitization to prevent SQL injection
- Regular security scans and updates
- IP-based rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Secure, HTTP-only session cookies

This implementation plan balances technical requirements with user experience, ensuring a smooth development process while creating a delightful experience for wedding guests.
